JSX
    its not HTML in JS
    its HTML-Like or XML-Like Syntax


React.createElement => ReactElement - JS Object => HTMLElement(render)

JSX => React.createElement => ReactElement - JS Object => HTMLElement(render) 

Attributes in JSX: 
 - The change of class attribute to className:
 - Creation of custom attributes:We can also use custom attributes in JSX. For custom attributes, the names of such attributes should be prefixed by data-* attribute.

Rules to Write JSX:
 - Always return a single Root Element: When there are multiple elements in a component and you want to return all of them wrap them inside a single component
 - Close all the tags: When we write tags in HTML some of them are self closing like the <img> tag but JSX requires us to close all of them so image tag will be represented as <img />
 - Use camelCase convention wherever possible: When writing JSX if we want to give class to a tag we have to use the className attribute which follows camelCase convention.
